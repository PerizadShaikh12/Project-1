# Speech to Text Converter
When it comes to our interactions with machines, things have gotten a lot more complicated. We’ve gone from large mechanical buttons to touchscreens. However, hardware isn’t the only thing that’s changing. Throughout the history of computers, the text has been the primary method of input. But thanks to developments in NLP and ML (Machine Learning), Data Science, we now have the means to use speech as a medium for interacting with our gadgets in the near future.
Speech Recognition is an important feature in several applications used such as home automation, artificial intelligence, etc.This project is a speech to text converter that allows you to convert spoken words into written text.
